    "can open a playlist for that genre through Spotify and listen to example tracks that \n",
    "characterize that genre. The dataset expands to the Spotify playlists themselves,\n",
    "where their API can be used to gather information about the playlist and audio \n",
    "features the songs themselves. Each subgenre has a table of related subgenres,\n",
    "and opposite subgenres as well as example artists whose work heavily fits into the \n",

    "We used python and BeautifulSoup to scrape our initial dataset from this website. It includes, for each subgenre, the related subgenres, the subgenres which are deemed the \"farthest away\" from them, as well as that subgenres related artists. Furthermore, we collected the size of the elements referring to these entities because the website sizes elements according to how related they are (or not related), to possibly use as weights for the edges. \n",
    "We also generated the dataset called \"school_genres\" using the every school add on at http://everynoise.com/everyschool.cgi. We got all schools in the USA and the most popular genres for that school, and we also collected the links to the related spotify playlists for that school in order to gather data about music features. In addition those related genres have weights that are displayed by the font size, so that information was scraped from the website, so for each genre's related genres there is a list of weights as well. This will provide an interesting weighted graph.\n",

    "\n",
    "Finding community structure can be done with several algorithms such as AGM, BigCLAM,\n",
    "Spectral Graph Partitioning, Graph Laplacian, and Modularity Maximization. In addition to this\n",
    "each song has a set of audio features $\\{key,mode,time-signature,acousticness,etc..\\}$. With \n",
    "this set of features we can construct a vector for each song and get averages for the subgenre \n",
    "playlists. Generes could then be generated using clustering algorithms like as GMM and K-Means.\n",
    "In addition to the exploration of music subgenres *everynoise* provides a list of the top genres\n",
    "for each over 2000 universities. This can be analyzed by using graphical orderings/embeddings\n",
    "to find the ordering of top genres of across universities in United States. This ordering can \n",
    "be constructed with page rank and the SpringRank Hamiltonian.\n",
    "The hypothesis is that the different community detection algorithms will in general find the majority of same communities with only little outliers and edge cases that will vary between each of the 5 methods.  The analysis will use Python and specifically pre-constructed network packages such as NetworkX and ideally graph-tool (for it's performance)."
